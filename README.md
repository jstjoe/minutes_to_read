This app estimates how long it will take the agent to read the current ticket's comment thread. It also provides the agent an estimate of how long it will take the average end-user to read their latest comment.

### The following information is displayed:

* Estimated time for the agent to read all current comments other than what they are adding.
* Estimated time for the end-user to read the comment the agent is currently adding.
